## Homework (due Monday 3/6)

* Madlibs (`5-madlibs` folder)
* 99 Bottles of Beer in the browser window:
    - Remember the 99 Bottles of Beer assignment? For this assignment, you'll be creating a website that programatically 
    displays the lyrics to that song.
    - You'll need to create both an HTML file and a JavaScript file.
    - In your HTML file, you'll want to have an unordered list (`<ul>`) that contains all of your lyrics.
    - Each line of the song should appear inside of a list item (`<li>`) within that unordered list.
    - Your JavaScript file should programatically append each line of the song to the page--no hard-coding lyrics in HTML!
    - Do this in vanilla JavaScript to get practice using those methods.
    - Bonus: redo the exercise in jQuery!
* BONUS homework: Dice (`6-dice folder`)
    - Creating a page where every time the user hits the "Roll Dice" button, the screen randomly updates the two dice. 
    - Specific instructions in the `js/app.js` folder
