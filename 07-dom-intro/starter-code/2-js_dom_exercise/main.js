Making a favorites list: DOM manipulation


- When the user clicks the submit button, take the value they've typed 
  into the input box and add it to the list (remember: appendChild)

- Also, when a new item is added to the list, clear the input box.  
  (Hint: the `value` property of the input box, before anyone types in it,
  is the empty string.)

Bonus:

When they click submit without typing anything, alert the user 
"you must type in a value!"
