## Homework (due Monday 3/13)

- Finish Open Weather Map project (`3_jquery_ajax_exercise folder`)
    - Bonus items are optional (input boxes and Kelvin -> Fahrenheit conversion) 
    - Add darksky.net as a second data source ([documentation at `https://darksky.net/dev/`](https://darksky.net/dev/)). How you integrate the new data into the web page is up to you â€” it can replace the temperature returned by Open Weather Map, you can show both forecasts, or you can create an interface that gives users a choice of which to view.
