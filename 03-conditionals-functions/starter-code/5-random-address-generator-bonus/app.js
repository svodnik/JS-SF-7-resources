/*
Optional bonus work on conditionals and functions:

    Write a script that can generate random addresses
    As a first step, create arrays that contain dummy data for each of the following: street number, street name, city name, state name, and zip code
    Your script should randomly select one item from each of these arrays and then use them to construct a random address
    Each time you load or reload the page in a browser, your program should print a new randomly-generated address to the terminal. For example:
    
    34578 Dolphin Street, Wonka NY, 44506
