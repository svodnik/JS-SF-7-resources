// Create a makeCar function
// ---
// Define a function called makeCar() that takes two parameters (model, color),
// makes a new object literal for a car using those params, and returns that object.
// Be sure your function returns the fuel property and the drive and refuel methods 
// that you worked with in the previous exercise.


var celica = makeCar("Toyota Celica", "Lime Green");
console.log(celica);
