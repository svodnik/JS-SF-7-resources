    The `queueCreator()` function is supposted to help us order all of our guests upon arrival. However, if you run the code, you will see that every person in our queueList is given the same position.
    Fix `queueCreator()` so that each guest is given her correct position in the list. (1, then 2, then 3)
    
    __HINT__: Brush up on closures!
