/*
    1) Create a function that accepts a number as a parameter, adds the number to an array, and logs the array value to the console.
    2) Modify your function so it returns an inner function, using a closure to reference the array created by the outer function.
        You should then be able to pass additional values to the returned function and have them added to the original array. HINT: The inner function will need to accept a parameter for the new array element, but the outer function will no longer need to accept a parameter.
    3) Test your code by creating two different arrays using the main function, assigning each a different variable name.
        You should then be able to call each of these new functions to add values to each of the arrays independently, without affecting each other's values.
